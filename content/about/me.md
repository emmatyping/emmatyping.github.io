Hi! My name is Ethan and I am a passionate open source developer living in Berkeley, CA. I love studying compilers, programming languages, type systems, and on occaison electronic gadgets.

I started learning to program when I was in high school, when I taught myself Python 2. Since then, I've been learning more about programming languages, both their designs and implementations. My current interests are in Python, Rust, JITs, type systems and quantum computers! I also enjoy tinkering with microcontrollers and Raspberry Pis.

In my open source work, I am a core developer on the mypy project, and a contributor to CPython, focusing on porting Python to the web.

I currently work on the open source team at [Sentry](https://sentry.io), a really cool error/performance monitoring software. In my free time I like to work on the above mentioned open source projects and play Minecraft.
